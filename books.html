        <p>William Shakespeare, born in 1564, was an English playwright, poet, and actor, widely regarded as one of the greatest writers in the English language. His works, including plays like *Romeo and Juliet*, *Hamlet*, and *Macbeth*, explore themes of love, power, betrayal, and fate. Shakespeare's influence on literature, theater, and the English language is profound, with many of his phrases and expressions still used today. He passed away in 1616.</p>
